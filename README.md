# Missionaries-and-cannibals

(1) Solve the missionaries and cannibals problem.  State is 6 ints: (M1, C1, B1, M2, C2, B2) on the start (1) and other (2) sides.  Find a path that goes from the initial state to the goal state (which, if not specified, is the state with no people or boats on the start side.)

(2) Write a function, mc_problem2, that solves the missionary and cannibal problem by making a call to shortest_path_search. Add 
any code below and change the arguments in the return statement's call to the shortest_path_search function.
